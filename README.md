# Rust & SQLite By Examples

Work In Progress. Prep work for the future **Rust with SQLite by Examples** YouTube video on the [jeremychone](https://youtube.com/jeremychone) channel.
                  

## **IMPORTANT**: 

- This is a preview repository for the upcoming YouTube full tutorial on Rust with SQLite (on [jeremychone](https://youtube.com/jeremychone) channel). 
- It will undergo "git force pushes" occasionally until the video is ready for E01 (episode 01).
- Ensure you git clone it and create your own branch, so you can git reset `main` without losing your history.
- Note that any changes or additions will be additive, and I do not plan to remove any examples.
