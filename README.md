# Rust & SQLite By Examples

Work in progress; this is the `rust-xp-sqlite-jc`, which is not the upcoming `rust-xp-sqlite`, but a JC-specific branch that will probably be removed after `rust-xp-sqlite` is completed. This is preparatory work for the future **Rust with SQLite by Examples** YouTube video on the [jeremychone](https://youtube.com/jeremychone) channel.

## **IMPORTANT**: 

- This is a preview repository for the upcoming YouTube full tutorial on Rust with SQLite (on the [jeremychone](https://youtube.com/jeremychone) channel). 
- It will undergo "git force pushes" occasionally until the video is ready for E01 (episode 01).
- Ensure you `git clone` it and create your own branch so you can `git reset main` without losing your history.
- Note that any changes or additions will be additive, and I do not plan to remove any examples.
